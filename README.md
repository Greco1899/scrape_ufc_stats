# Scrape UFC Stats
Scrape all available UFC events data, fights stats, and fighter details and from [ufcstats.com](http://ufcstats.com/) and save in CSV format.
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Prerequisites
```
Python 3
```
Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Introduction

Data for all events, fights, and fighters have scraped and saved as the following data files:
```
ufc_events.csv
ufc_fight_details.csv
ufc_fight_results.csv
ufc_fight_stats.csv
ufc_fighter_details.csv
ufc_fighter_tott.csv
```

To download the CSV files without running any code, click `Code` > `Download ZIP` or clone the repo.
<br>
<br>

You can also scrape the all data for fight stats again using the notebook `scrape_ufc_stats_all_historical_data.ipynb`, and all data for fighter tale of the tape again using the notebook `scrape_ufc_stats_fighter_tott.ipynb`.
Do note these will each take a few hours to complete.

Once you have the up-to-date historical data for fight stats, you can run the notebook `scrape_ufc_stats_unparsed_data.ipynb` or the script `scrape_ufc_stats_unparsed_data.py` to scrape the only latest fights and refresh the data.

The notebook `scrape_ufc_stats_working_example.ipynb` can be used for testing or debugging. The code here is broken down into sections which can be executed to scrape single data points, e.g. scraping stats for one fight only.

Do feel free to reach out with any comments, suggestions, or issues. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Data Refresh

The script `scrape_ufc_stats_unparsed_data.py` has been added to [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/?affiliate_id=00a8b72b) and will run daily to check and scrape new fights and fighters and push the refreshed data files to this repository. 

This keeps the data files up to date with the latest fight and fighter stats and you can quickly download and use the CSV files above without running any code.
